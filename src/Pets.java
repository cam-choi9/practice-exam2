/*
Your solution should use good OOP practices and demonstrate an Abstract class with at least one abstract function!
Write a program to:
  Store two types of pets---cats and dogs
  When you create a pet, the constructor takes a name. Cats also take a number of lives remaining.
  All pets have a printName() function that prints the name
  Cats have a makeNoise() function:  "NAME says meow" 
  Dogs have a makeNoise() function: "woof woof says NAME"
Your main method should:
  Create a list with two dogs named Fido and Spot, and three cats named Fluffy, Mowzer, and Pig
  Print the names of all the pets
  Call the makeNoise function on the first dog and second cat
*/

// ***YOUR NAME HERE***

public class Pets {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    /* Create a list with two dogs named Fido and Spot
       and three cats named Fluffy, Mowzer, and Pig */

    /* Print the names of all the pets */

    /* Call the makeNoise function on the first dog 
       and second cat */
